This package contains the code I used for my CSEC 491 thesis: Q-Learning in Repeated Price Competition: Analyzing Convergence \& Equilibrium Outcomes

I have included a README taken from Calvano et al. (2020)'s source code, which I used as a foundation for my simulation codebase, written in Fortran. I made two separate versions of the codebaseâ€”one optimized to help me conduct single agent analysis and the other to help me conduct multi-agent analysis. I have included sample input files to help guide anyone who attempts to use my code. Note that compiling my code requires Intel's Fortran compiler.

I have also included my R scripts, used for all data visualizations in my paper.
